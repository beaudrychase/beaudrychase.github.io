This is my first post about my ongoing personal project living_light. In this post I will describe my intentions in creating the project and the development process.

## What is living_light

living_light is a decorative lamp that slowly rises and falls in brightness at the rate of meditative breathing. The color and brightness follows the day's natural progression and our circadian rhythms. During the day it is a bright blueish white and then at sunset it transitions to a dark red for the night. It is an open invitation to pause to take a breath and a reminder follow the natural solar cycle.

The user interface is simple. It can either be plugged in or not, otherwise there is no way for the user to change the behavior. Allowing for customization would detract from the experience.

## The Intention of living_light


- Physicality
- Restoration
- Nothing to do
