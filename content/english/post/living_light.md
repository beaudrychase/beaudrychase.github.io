This is my first post about my ongoing personal project, living_light. In this post I introduce the project and describe my intentions for creating it.

## What is living_light

living_light is a decorative lamp that slowly rises and falls in brightness at the rate of meditative breathing. The color and brightness follow the day's natural progression and our circadian rhythms. During the day, it is a bright blueish-white and then at sunset, it transitions to a dark red for the night. [Perhaps add a sentence abou blue light mimiciing the light during the day and red light being easier on our eyes at night.] The light serves as an open invitation to pause to take a breath and a reminder to tap into nature and follow our biological rythm and the Earth's solar cycle.

Currently the light intentionally has a very limited user interface. I had spent a lot of time implementing a text interface to change the behavior of the light through Telegram messenger's bot API that would take simple commands to change the length of the breath cycle, the color, and brightness. However, I found that having these options changed the way I engaged with the light; I found myself distracted by assessing whether or not I should change the settings instead of meditating with it. Having these options detracted from the experience I designed, so I removed them. [Perhaps add a sentence to wrap up by talking about how the experience is now without those options.]

The prototype I have is a Esp32 mounted on a breadboard and connected to a 8x8 LED matrix that lives in a ziplock bag to keep everything together. I aim to make a more respectable 3d printed housing in the future.

I hope you have a better understanding of my light project. Check back in for future posts where I delve into the technical aspects of living_light!
